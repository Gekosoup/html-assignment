    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Maya Taylor and I am a twenty two year old student living in Ottawa, Ontario!
      I have some experience with coding and graphic design from a previous program in Algonquin! 
      I’ve worked as a teachers assistant for a web design class in Algonquin and have done a few graphic design projects for local Ottawa businesses. 
      I also have experience as an artist vendor. This has taught me how to create printed products from digital art in various forms (prints, stickers, apparel). 
    </p>
    
    <p>I love video games, skateboarding and art! I have always held a passion for the digital world and art since I was young and I've always known that I wanted to find a field to apply those passions in a professional way!      .
      I work at a sushi restaurant and i also love to cook and bake as well!
      My favourite video games are Red Dead Redemption 2 and Detroit: Become human!
      The graphic styles of the games heavily inspire my digital art!
